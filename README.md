## Description
We want you to implement a REST API endpoint that given a list of products, applies some
discounts to them and can be filtered.
You are free to choose whatever language and tools you are most comfortable with.
Please add instructions on how to run it and publish it in Github.

## Conditions 

  The prices are integers for example, 100.00â‚¬ would be 10000 .
  
  You can store the products as you see fit (json file, in memory, rdbms of choice)
  
  Given that:
   Products in the boots category have a 30% discount.
   The product with sku = 000003 has a 15% discount.
   Provide a single endpoint
  
  GET /products
   Can be filtered by category as a query string parameter
   (optional) Can be filtered by price as a query string parameter, this filter applies
   before discounts are applied.
   Returns a list of Product with the given discounts applied when necessary
   Product model
   price.currency is always EUR
  
  When a product does not have a discount, price.final and price.original should be the same number and discount_percentage should be null.
  
  When a product has a discount price.original is the original price, price.final is the amount with the discount applied and discount_percentage represents the
  applied discount with the % sign.
  
  Example product with a discount of 30% applied: 
  
    `{
      "sku": "000001",
      "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
      "category": "boots",
      "price": {
          "original": 89000,
          "final": 62300,
          "discount_percentage": "30%",
          "currency": "EUR"
      }
    }`
  
  Example product without a discount:
  
      `{
        "sku": "000001",
        "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
        "category": "boots",
        "price": {
            "original": 89000,
            "final": 89000,
            "discount_percentage": null,
            "currency": "EUR"
        }
      }`
